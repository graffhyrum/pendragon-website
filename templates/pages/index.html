    <div class="text-xl">
        <p>
            My name is Joshua Pendragon, and I am an experienced SDET with over eight years of experience in ensuring
            software
            quality. I began my career in the US Navy as a Cryptologic Technician, where I developed my attention to
            detail
            and
            analytical skills. Since then, I have transitioned into the tech industry, working on testing challenges in
            various
            fields, such as point-of-sale systems and B2B platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my most recent role as an SDET at OvationCXM, I led the development and maintenance of a Playwright
            project
            for
            cross-product testing. I am proud to have driven improvement from the ground up by breaking down complex
            tests,
            composing reusable logic, and optimizing error handling. This has enabled us to fully automate our smoke
            suite
            and
            increase our testing velocity significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from coding, I actively mentor team members, guide project discussions, and introduce effective tools
            and
            processes to contribute to continuous improvement. For example, I implemented integrations with CI/CD
            pipelines
            and
            issue trackers, streamlined our Agile workflow, and built a Trello-based onboarding system for new hires.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recognize that organizational failures often stem from a lack of alignment, so one of my primary areas of
            focus is
            to bridge
            those divides strategically and ensure a united vision and understanding. I constantly look for the smallest
            change
            with the
            biggest impact, whether that be writing new test coverage, drafting documentation to deconstruct silos, or
            bringing data and perspective to the people that need it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For professional growth, I am currently learning Rust, C++, Go, and SurrealDb to broaden my skill set.
            When I'm not coding, I'm chatting with friends on Discord while running content in WoW or FFXIV, clearing my
            unplayed Steam backlog, or practicing a song from Stronghold on the mandolin.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a proud supporter of the <a href="https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship
            Manifesto</a>, I pursue quality and professionalism in all my work.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am actively seeking opportunities that align with my passion for software design, development, and QA
            automation. If you like what you see here, reach out and say hello!
